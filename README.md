# Machine Learning Notebooks
Helpful noteboks that I compiled while learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning from various sources on the Internet. 

## NumPy Basics:
1. [NumPy Basics](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maykulkarni/Machine-Learning-Notebooks/blob/master/00.%20NumPy%20Basics/1.%20NumPy%20Basics.ipynb)

## Data Preprocessing:
1. [Feature Selection](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maykulkarni/Machine-Learning-Notebooks/blob/master/01.%20Data%20Preprocessing/1.%20Feature%20Selection.ipynb): Imputing missing values, Encoding, Binarizing.
